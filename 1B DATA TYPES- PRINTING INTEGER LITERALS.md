# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the following integer literals: 123, 456, 789.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Initialize the integer literals `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the numbers `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python

a=123
b=456
c=789
print(a,b,c)

```
